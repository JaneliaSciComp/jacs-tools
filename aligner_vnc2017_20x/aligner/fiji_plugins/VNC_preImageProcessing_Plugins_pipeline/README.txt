This directory contains only files that should be deployed into the Fiji plugins directory.

Important: Do not create sub directories in here! Fiji only searches one level deep.

Source files are found in ../../single_neuron/Toolkits/VNCScripts/scripts/VNC_preImageProcessing_Plugins_pipeline/

Important: Deploying the source files into Fiji plugins directory leads to inconsistent behavior, as Fiji tries to compile them. 
It's better to hand compile the source files and only put the class files in this directory.
